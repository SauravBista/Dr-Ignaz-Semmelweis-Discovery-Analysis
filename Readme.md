Dr. Semmelweis Handwashing Discovery

This project explores the famous discovery of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, who identified the critical importance of handwashing in reducing childbed fever in maternity clinics. Using historical data from 1841 to 1849, the project analyzes the dramatic reduction in mortality rates following the introduction of handwashing practices.

Introduction

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician who revolutionized medical practices by advocating for handwashing in clinical settings. His groundbreaking work led to a significant decrease in mortality rates caused by childbed fever, and his discovery is considered one of the earliest forms of evidence-based medicine.

This project uses data from Dr. Semmelweis's time to analyze the effects of handwashing on patient outcomes and aims to show how simple hygiene practices can save lives.
Data

The data consists of historical records from the two maternity wards in the Vienna General Hospital from 1841 to 1849. The dataset includes the number of births and deaths in both wards, with key focus on the time period before and after the introduction of handwashing in mid-1847.
Analysis

The analysis uses Python to investigate the data, focusing on:

    Monthly birth and death records
    Mortality rates before and after the introduction of handwashing
    Visualization of the reduction in deaths following this practice

Key libraries used:

    Pandas for data manipulation
    Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Key Insights

    Significant Drop in Mortality: The introduction of handwashing in 1847 led to a sharp decline in mortality rates among mothers.
    Correlation between Handwashing and Mortality: The data clearly shows a strong negative correlation between the practice of handwashing and deaths due to childbed fever.
    Historical Impact: This analysis underscores the importance of hygiene in medical practices, a lesson that is still highly relevant today.

Conclusion

Dr. Semmelweis's work laid the foundation for modern antiseptic procedures. The data in this project highlights the critical role of handwashing in saving lives, a practice that is still a cornerstone of public health.
